# TypeScript String Enums

Typesafe string enums in TypeScript.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dphilipson/typescript-string-enums.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dphilipson/typescript-string-enums)

## Installation

```
npm install --save typescript-string-enums
```

## Usage

Define an enum as follows:

``` javascript
// Status.ts
import { Enum } from "typescript-string-enums";

export const Status = Enum("RUNNING", "STOPPED");
export type Status = Enum<typeof Status>;
```

Use it elsewhere:

``` javascript
import { Status } from "./Status";

console.log(Status.RUNNING); // -> "RUNNING";

// Works fine.
const goodStatus: Status = Status.RUNNING;

 // TypeScript error: Type '"hello"' is not assignable to type '"RUNNING" | "STOPPED"'
const badStatus: Status = "hello";

// Enum can be used for discriminated unions:

type State = RunningState | StoppedState;

interface RunningState {
    status: typeof Status.RUNNING;
    pid: number;
}

interface StoppedState {
    status: typeof Status.STOPPED;
    shutdownTime: Date;
}

function saySomethingAboutState(state: State) {
    // The following typechecks.
    if (state.status === Status.RUNNING) {
        console.log("The pid is " + state.pid);
    } else if (state.status === Status.STOPPED) {
        console.log("The shutdown time is " + state.shutdownTime);
    }
}
```

## Motivation

Enums are useful for cleanly specifying a type that can take one of a few specific values.
TypeScript users typically implement enums in one of two ways: built-in
[TypeScript enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) or string literals, but
each of these has drawbacks.

### Why not built-in enums?

Built-in enums have one big drawback. Their runtime value is a number, which is annoying during
development and makes them unsuitable for use with external APIs.

``` javascript
enum Status {
    RUNNING, STOPPED
}

const state = { status: Status.RUNNING, pid: 12345 };
console.log(state);
// -> { status: 0, pid: 12345 }. What status was that again?
// I hope you're not expecting other services to send you objects that look like this.
```

### Why not string literals?

Using string literals throughout a program leaves it vulnerable to bugs caused by typos or
incomplete refactors. For example:

``` javascript
type Status = "RUNNING" | "STOPPED";

...

// Typo "SOTPPED" is not caught by typechecker.
// Pretty bad bug- this block will never run.
if (state.status === "SOTPPED") {
    soundTheAlarm();
}
```

Further, string literals make refactoring difficult. Suppose I have two enums:

``` javascript
type Status = "RUNNING" | "STOPPED";
type TriathlonStage = "SWIMMING" | "CYCLING" | "RUNNING";
```

Then if at a later stage I want to change `Status` to be `"STARTED" | "STOPPED"`, there's no easy
way to do it. I can't globally find/replace `"RUNNING"` to `"STARTED"` because it will also change
the unrelated string constants representing `TriathlonStage`. Instead, I have to examine every
occurrance of the string `"RUNNING"` to see if it needs to change.

I might try to solve both problems by introducing constants for the string literals, but this has
issues as well:

``` javascript
type Status = "RUNNING" | "STOPPED";

// Naive attempts to define constants for these don't work.
const StatusNaive = {
    RUNNING: "RUNNING",
    STOPPED: "STOPPED",
};

// Type error even though it shouldn't be, because StatusNaive.RUNNING has type
// string which is not assignable to Status.
const status: Status = StatusNaive.RUNNING;

// Correctly defining constants is annoyingly repetitive.
const Status = {
    RUNNING: "RUNNING" as "RUNNING",
    STOPPED: "STOPPED" as "STOPPED",
};
```

This library is effectively a programmatic version of these repetitive definitions. It attempts to
provide the best of both worlds: string enums with the convenience of built-in enums.

## How It Works

This section is not necessary to use this library, but for those curious about how it is
implemented, read on. The explanation uses the concepts of index types and mapped types, as
described in TypeScript's
[Advanced Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) page.

The entire source of this library is

``` javascript
export function Enum<V extends string>(...values: V[]): { [K in V]: K } {
    const result: any = {};
    values.forEach((value) => result[value] = value);
    return result;
}

export type Enum<T> = T[keyof T];
```

We are creating a function named `Enum` and a type named `Enum`, so both can be imported with a
single symbol.

In TypeScript, a string constant is a type (for example, in `const foo = "Hello"`, the
variable `foo` is assigned type `"Hello"`). This means that the array

``` javascript
["RUNNING", "STOPPED"]
```

can be inferred to have type `("RUNNING" | "STOPPED")[]`, and so when it is passed into a function
with type signature

``` javascript
function Enum<V extends string>(...values: V[]): { [K in V]: K }
```

the type parameter `V` is thus inferred to be `"RUNNING" | "STOPPED"`. Then the return type
`{ [K in V]: K }` is a mapped type which describes an object whose keys are the types that
make up `V` and for each such key has a value equal to that key. Hence, the type of
`Enum("RUNNING", "STOPPED")` is

``` javascript
// This is a type, not an object literal.
{
    RUNNING: "RUNNING";
    STOPPED: "STOPPED";
}
```

Next, consider the definition

``` javascript
type Enum<T> = T[keyof T];
```

This is an index type which describes, for a given keyed type `T`, the type obtained by indexing
into `T` with an arbitrary one of its keys (the syntax `T[keyof T]` is meant to evoke the
expression `t[key]` for some `key` in `t`). When passing in an arbitrary key to the object from the
previous step, we get a value which might be any one of the object's values, and so its type is thus
the union of the types of the object's values. Hence, `Enum<typeof Enum("RUNNING", "STOPPED")>`
evaluates to `"RUNNING" | "STOPPED"`, which is what we want.
